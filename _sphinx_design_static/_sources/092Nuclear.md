# 9.2 Nuclear Energy

## Exercise 6: Nuclear Energy

Compared with fossil fuels, nuclear energy is a cleaner form of energy, and depending on the source of fuel used, there is a limitless source of fuel available to power modern human societies. However, there are also many other problems with nuclear power generation and primarily with the type of waste that is created as well as the perception of the safety of these power plants. Use the resources below to explore the benefits and problems with nuclear energy.
