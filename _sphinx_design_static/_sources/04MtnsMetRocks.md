# **4 Mountains and Metamorphic Rocks**

In this lab, we will focus on learning about mountain building at convergent plate boundaries as well as, how the theory of plate tectonics helps us understand why mountains occur in specific plate boundaries, and the typical hazards associated with mountain building zones.  Because of the specific stress applied to rocks in these convergent boundaries, metamorphic rocks are also more likely to be found here. We will learn about the most common types of metamorphic rocks associated with these environments.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- the links between plate tectonics and mountain building,
- the susceptibility of these mountains to erosion and landslides, and
- how metamorphic rocks are created at these zones.
