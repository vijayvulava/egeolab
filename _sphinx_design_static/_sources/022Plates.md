# 2.2 Fundamentals of Plate Tectonics

Deformation and tectonic activity in Earth’s crust fractures rock creating geological faults.  Any movement along these faults causes a release of energy causing enormous damage to Earth’s surface and directly impacting life on Earth.

## Exercise 3: Plate Boundaries

Watch the short introduction video to learn the basics of plate tectonics, the internal structure of Earth where earthquakes occur, and plate interactions that can result in earthquakes. As you watch the video, take notes to help answer the questions that follow.

```{admonition} Plate Boundaries and Faults
Answer the following questions about the plate boundaries:

18. What layer of the Earth are tectonic plates made of?
19. List the two types of lithospheres.
20. Identify the three types of plate boundaries.
21. Match the three types of plate boundaries with how the plates interact: Pull apart, Collide/converge, or Sliding past each other.
22. Match the three fault types with how the hanging wall fault block moves relative to the foot wall: Hanging Wall/Foot Wall/Neither goes down
23. Match the three fault types with how they experience stress: Tensional/ Compressional/Shear stress
24. Match the three fault types with the plate boundaries where they may occur: Divergent/Convergent/Transform plate boundaries.
25. Earthquakes occur in one of these physical layers: Brittle/Ductile
26. More than 75% of all earthquakes on Earth occur one of these types of plate boundaries.

## Exercise 4: Tectonic Features

In the interactive map below, you can explore the different kinds of plate boundaries as wells as the names of the major tectonic plates. In this map, major earthquakes recorded near the plate boundaries are shown as yellow-colored dots, while volcanoes are shown as red-colored rectangles. 

Can you identify the different types of boundaries from the three hatch patterns (Saw-tooth patterned lines, thick red lines, thin red lines) applied to the boundaries?

```{admonition} Tectonic Features on the Earth

Let’s explore some of the locations around the world and the types of plate boundaries at these locations. Use the above interactive map to answer the following questions.

27. Match the three boundary types with the patterns shown in the map above: toothed patterned lines, thick red lines, thin red lines

*For each of the regions listed below identify the following: 
	1. type of plate boundary (convergent, divergent, transform)
	2. dominant fault type (normal, reverse/thrust, and strike-slip)
	3. names of major tectonic plates
	4. other geological features (mountains, trenches, volcanoes, etc.)*

28.  San Andreas Fault
29. Andes Mountains
30. Aleutian Island Chain
31. Himalaya Mountains
32. Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge
33. Some types of the convergent boundaries are called subduction zones. Describe how these convergent boundaries are different from other convergent boundaries.
34. Which of the following regions are subduction zones?  San Andreas Fault, Andes Mountains, Aleutian Island Chain, Himalaya Mountains, Atlantic Mid-Ocean Ridge

Study the the figures below. The first figure shows a map view of the plate boundary and EQ map of the Central American region, while the second figure shows a cross-section view of the subduction zone in the Kuril region of Russia. The dense oceanic plate subducts (**subducting plate**), while the less-dense continental plate is called the **overriding plate**. A deep trench forms at the plate boundary here.

```{admonition} Subduction Zones
Answer the following questions using information from the above figures.

35. Match the subducting and overriding plates in Figure 1.
36. According to data in Figures 1 and 2, where do shallow earthquakes (0-33 km depth) occur? Closer to the plate boundary or farther away from the boundary?
37. The depth of the earthquake (hypocenter) increases as the distance increases from the plate boundary (trench) increases. T/F
38. Shallow-to-deep earthquakes are associated with subduction zones. T/F
39. Subduction occurs at convergent plate boundaries having which two types of crust converging? Continental-Oceanic, Continental-Continental, or Oceanic-Oceanic.
40. Based on the map of the earthquake patterns in Figures 1 and 2 and on your understanding of subduction zones, subduction occurring in the Himalaya Mountains. T/F
41. Explain your answer to the previous question.
