# 1.1 Introduction to Minerals

According to the International Mineralogical Association, “a mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.”  This is an overarching technical definition of a mineral and has many underlying attributes embedded within that definition.  For example, since all geological processes are natural, a mineral has to occur naturally.
