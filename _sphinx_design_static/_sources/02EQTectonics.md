# **2 Earthquakes and  Plate Tectonics**

In this lab, we will focus on learning about earthquakes, how the theory of plate tectonics helps us understand why they occur, and the typical hazards associated with earthquakes.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- how earthquakes are generated and the terminology associated with earthquakes,
- the role of plate tectonics in the generation of earthquakes,
- typical hazards associated with earthquakes, and
- potentially vulnerable areas in the Charleston region for earthquake-related damage.
