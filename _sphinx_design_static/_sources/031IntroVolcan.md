# 3.1 Magma and Volcanoes

In this section, we will explore the properties of magma and how their mineral composition and physical properties may impact their behavior during volcanic eruptions. Magma can have different amounts of silica ($\ce{SiO4}$) and dissolved gases (like $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{SO2}$, and $\ce{H2O}$). These factors affect how magma erupts and the type of volcano it will form when it solidifies. Note that the amount of silica in magma and its viscosity are positively correlated. Magma can contain 1% to 10% dissolved gases, much like a soda contains dissolved $\ce{CO2}$.

Watch the video below for a short introduction about volcanoes around the world. As you watch the video, take notes to help answer the questions that follow.

## Exercise 1: Magma

```{admonition} Properties of Magma
Let's examine the physical and chemical properties of magma, which controls the type and impact of volcanic eruptions.  Use the resources below and answer the following questions.

- Watch the above video for a quick introduction to volcanoes and magma. As always take notes while you watch the video.
- [4 Igneous Processes and Volcanoes – An Introduction to Geology](https://slcc.pressbooks.pub/introgeology/chapter/4-igneous-processes-and-volcanoes/)
- As you consult the above resources, note how silica ($\ce{SiO4}$) and dissolved gases (like $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{SO2}$, and $\ce{H2O}$) composition affect the eruption style.

1.  What is magma and where does it come from?
2.  What is lava?
3.  Magma does not rise to the surface to form volcanoes everywhere. Where do most volcanoes form?
4.  Define viscosity.
5.  What is more viscous: Water or Maple syrup?
6.  Lava with low viscosity will be able to flow a long distance before it cools and hardens into rock, or to cool and harden close to the vent?
7.  The lava in the above question has low silica or high silica?
8.  Lava with high viscosity will be able to flow a long distance before it cools and hardens into rock or cool and harden close to the vent?
9.  The lava in the above question has low silica or high silica?
10.  Contents from one of the two sealed bottles will erupt when vigorously shaken: Plain water or Soda?
11.  Compared to magma with lower gas content magma with a higher gas content will erupt: More explosively or Less explosively
12.  Define an effusive eruption.
13.  Define an explosive eruption.
14.  Silica and gas content in effusive eruptions are high or low?
