# 2.1 Fundamentals of Earthquakes

Deformation and tectonic activity in Earth’s crust fractures rock creating geological faults.  Any movement along these faults causes a release of energy causing enormous damage to Earth’s surface and directly impacting life on Earth.

The video below provides a short overview of earthquake hazards.

## Exercise 2: The Strongest Earthquake

The US Geological Survey (USGS) is one of the oldest and largest national institutions that is tasked by the US Congress to study Earth’s resources, hazards, and environments.  They have an active network of scientists and advanced technology to study hazards such as earthquakes.  The  [Earthquake Hazards (usgs.gov)](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards) program serves as the largest gateway to the latest and historic information about earthquakes in the US and the rest of the world.  You will use the exercise below to familiarize yourself with identifying relevant technical information from this resource.

```{admonition} The Strongest Recorded Earthquake
Use the USGS resources below to investigate the strongest recorded earthquake on Earth and answer the following questions:
- [Earthquake Hazards (usgs.gov)](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards)
- [Lists, Maps, and Statistics (usgs.gov)](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/lists-maps-and-statistics)

12. In which country did the strongest recorded earthquake occur?
13. What was the magnitude of this earthquake?
14. Where was the epicenter? (Report in Latitude Longitude format. E.g., CofC Cistern is 32º47’N 79º56’W)
15. Where was the hypocenter? (Report in km depth)
16. What were the major causes for the loss of life and property?
17. How can you tell if such intense earthquakes are normal or unusual to this region of the world?
