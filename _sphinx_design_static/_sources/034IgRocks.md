# 3.4 Igneous Rocks

In this section, we focus on igneous rocks that form in different igneous environments giving them unique composition and textures. Magma and lava in volcanic zones solidify to form igneous rocks. Igneous rocks are classified by composition into groups based on their silica content. Igneous rocks with high silica content will contain different minerals than those with low silica content, which will cause the rocks to be different colors. With some exceptions, we can usually tell the composition of a rock by its color. Below we will examine different types of igneous rocks and learn about their composition and cooling history.

## Exercise 8: Properties of Igneous Rocks

The types of minerals (composition) found in igneous rocks can be identified using color.
-   Felsic rocks contain high silica and are made of minerals that are light or pink colored.
-   Mafic rocks contain low silica and are made of high magnesium and iron minerals that are dark or green colored.
-   Intermediate rocks fall between Felsic and Mafic rocks in terms of composition and color.

The two main textures found in igneous rocks – coarse-grained (phaneritic) and fine-grained (aphanitic) - give us information about the volcanic history of the rock.

*Phaneritic* textured rocks have large crystals (the rock is coarse-grained). These rocks formed from slow-cooling magma underground, allowing time for crystals to grow large.

*Aphanitic* textured rocks have small crystals (the rock is fine-grained) and these rocks appear in one color overall. These rocks formed from faster-cooling lava at Earth’s surface, so there was no time for the crystals to grow.
