# 10.3 Global Change

Global change is an all-encompassing term used to highlight all the changes we should expect to see in the future due to the warming climate.  These changes include precipitation patterns, coastal storms, shifting of vegetation and growth seasons, newer endemic diseases, mass extinctions, etc.  Use the following resources to explore some of the impacts on the US and the rest of the world.
