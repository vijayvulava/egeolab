# 1.2 Minerals and their Properties

Minerals are commonly identified in the field and the lab conducting simple tests for various properties.  Many minerals have a unique set of properties that help us identify them by comparing those properties with published data.  

Here are some of the most widely used methods:
- Visual Examination: Initial identification often starts with a visual inspection of the mineral's color, luster (appearance of the mineral's surface in reflected light), and transparency or opacity.
- Hardness Test: The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is frequently used to determine a mineral's hardness by comparing it to the known hardness of ten standard minerals. It involves scratching the mineral with various objects of known hardness and observing if the mineral is scratched or not. For example, a mineral has hardness greater than 5.5 if glass cannot scratch it.  A copper penny has a hardness of 3.5 and a fingernail has a hardness of 2.5. Additionally, a zinc coated nail has a hardness of 4.
- Streak Test: This test involves rubbing the mineral against an unglazed porcelain plate to produce a streak of powdered mineral. The color of the streak can sometimes be different from the mineral's external color, providing a useful identification characteristic.
- Cleavage and Fracture: Cleavage refers to the way a mineral breaks along planes of weakness, producing flat surfaces. Fracture describes how a mineral breaks when it lacks cleavage. Observing cleavage or fracture patterns can help in identifying certain minerals.
- Specific Gravity: Specific gravity measures the density of a mineral compared to the density of water. It is determined by comparing the weight of a mineral specimen in air to its weight in water. This property can provide clues about a mineral's composition.
- Acid Test: Some minerals react with certain acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). By applying acid to a mineral and observing the resulting reaction, such as effervescence or the generation of gas bubbles, you can infer information about its composition.
- Magnetism: Some minerals are magnetic, meaning they are attracted to magnets. Testing a mineral's response to a magnet can aid in identification.
- Optical Properties: Minerals can exhibit various optical properties, such as double refraction, polarization, or fluorescence. Using a polarizing microscope or specialized tools, these properties can be examined to assist in identification.

More detailed investigations (e.g., spectroscopic techniques, X-ray diffraction) are needed to identify complex minerals in some cases.  In this lab, we will focus on some of the common minerals discussed in this course.
