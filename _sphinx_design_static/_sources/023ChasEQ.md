# 2.3 1886 Charleston Earthquake

In 1886, a powerful earthquake struck the Charleston region, causing enormous damage and loss to life and property. This earthquake was not only very destructive, it showed how powerful earthquakes can also strike away from plate boundaries. This intraplate (away from a plate boundary) earthquake was likely associated with ancient faults created during the breakup of Pangea. The earthquake also caused significant liquefaction.  This region regularly experiences minor earthquakes, but the recurrence interval of destructive earthquakes in this area is likely to be more than 1000 years.

In this section, we will explore the damage caused by this earthquake and learn about the causes for the vulnerability of the Charleston region as well as identify the areas that will likely experience damage in the event of another strong earthquake.

## Exercise 5: The 1886 Charleston Earthquake

Use the resources below to learn about this earthquake and the damage caused.
- [The 1886 Charleston Earthquake, South Carolina (usgs.gov)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ushis251/executive) – click on the Regional Information link for additional information about this earthquake.
- [Charleston Earthquake and Geology (arcgis.com)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/5ef486061a2d4d3f81ebc90b12969246) – examine the historical and recent pictures of the damage.  You will also note a historical picture of the Randolph Hall and other buildings that may look familiar.  Look for the earthquake bolts that were installed in Randolph Hall and Porter’s Lodge.

```{admonition} The 1886 Charleston Earthquake
Answer the following questions:

42. What was the estimated magnitude of this earthquake?
43. Where exactly is the epicenter of this earthquake? (Report in Latitude and Longitude).
44. You will notice that the epicenter is in a suburb of Charleston.  What is this area?  (Report name of town or area)
45. The depth/hypocenter of this earthquake is not reported. Explain why.
46. What is the most common type of damage seen in the pictures?
47. There are two photographs of nearly intact homes with a damaged masonry foundation.  What is the likely reason these buildings remained intact?
48. Overall, what types of structures experienced the most amount of damage?
49. How did the Randolph Hall, the Porter’s Lodge, and many similar historic buildings in the peninsula retrofit the buildings to prevent further damage?

## Exercise 6: Liquefaction

In the interactive map below, you can explore the different kinds of plate boundaries.  Liquefaction was observed during this earthquake especially in areas that were close to the epicenter of the earthquake.  This type of damage is observed when earthquakes strike coastal regions of the world.

Watch the demonstration below for a quick idea of how ground vibrations can cause liquefaction. If you feel adventurous, create your own liquefaction experiment!

-   Watch the videos above.
-   [11.4 The Impacts of Earthquakes – Physical Geology – 2nd Edition (opentextbc.ca)](https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeology2ed/chapter/11-4-the-impacts-of-earthquakes/)

50. Explain liquefaction.
51. What kind of ground materials are prone to liquefaction?
52. Areas near the coastlines are more susceptible to liquefaction because of the shallow water tables. T/F
53. In the animation shown in the third video, which seismogram had the highest amplitude waves (the most destructive)?
54. What type of ground was shown to be the most susceptible to liquefaction?
55. Based on the evidence presented so far, the Charleston region is susceptible to liquefaction in the event of another strong earthquake. T/F
56. List two other countries (mentioned in the second video), where liquefaction caused significant damage.
57. According to the second video above, what is the most common way to stabilize building foundations in coastal areas prone to seismic hazards?

## Exercise 7:  Geology and Susceptibility

The geology of Charleston and the surrounding regions made is especially vulnerable to the damage caused by the earthquake.  Over the past 100+ years, the Charleston peninsular land has changed dramatically on the edges of the peninsula. Use the maps below to examine the changes to the land footprint of the Charleston peninsula. Click and move the Swipe Bar to see changes. Focus on the areas next to Cooper and Ashley Rivers.
