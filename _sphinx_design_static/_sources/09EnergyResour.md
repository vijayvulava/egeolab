# **9 Energy Resources**

The United States relies on a variety of energy resources to meet its needs. The main types of energy resources commonly used in the U.S. include:
- fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas,
- nuclear power, and
- renewable energy, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and geothermal power.

These energy resources have different impacts on the environment, public health, and climate change. The U.S. is increasingly transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. However, fossil fuels still dominate the energy landscape, although their share is gradually decreasing as renewable energy adoption continues to grow. We will also explore the different sources of energy that people of SC rely on.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- different sources of energy and
- benefits and disadvantages of using these forms of energy.
