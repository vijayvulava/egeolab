# 7.1 Coastal Features

## Exercise 1: Sediment on Coastlines

The Earth’s surface is 29% land and 71% water. Coastlines are the interfaces between land and water and can have a profound influence on life on land.  In this section, we focus on different aspects of coastlines from sediment found at coastlines to the shape of coastlines.  Let’s begin with an examination of the types of sediment found on coastlines.

Watch the short video below to see the various kinds of sediment that collect in coastal environments. Even though the video is specific to New Zealand, the main sources of the sediment and the coastal processes observed are the same across the world. (Note: Turn on Closed Captioning if needed.)

8. What is the predominant composition of sand grains in most places around the world?
9. What is the chemical formula of silica sand?
10. Which of the following minerals is most resistant to weathering?
11. Igneous and metamorphic rocks (containing quartz, feldspars, mica, and amphiboles) are the more common rocks on the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountains. If these rocks are the source of all coastal sediment, which mineral is most likely to be found along the US Atlantic coastlines?
12. Sediment in all coastlines around the world is made of quartz. T/F
13. Why do smaller-sized sediments deposit along coastlines?
14. Where do sediment finer than sand (silt and clay) deposit relative to the coastlines?

## Exercise 2:  Shape of a Coastline

In addition to the sediment that is brought to the coastlines by streams, ocean waves play a crucial role in shaping coastlines.  Watch this video to learn how ocean waves are formed and answer the following questions:

17. The size of the waves is directly related to the length of the fetch. T/F
18. Big waves carry a significant amount of energy. T/F
19. Match the constructive and destructive waves with the following events: Transport and deposition of sediment/ Erosion of sediment.
20. Coastal storms create constructive waves. T/F
21. Wave refraction causes erosion and deposition in different parts of an active coastline. Match rocky headlands and wide bay and beaches with erosional and depositional environments.

## Exercise 3:  Erosion at Coastlines

First, let’s examine some of the main erosional features caused by ocean waves as shown in the video below.

23. Of the following rock types, which rock types are more readily eroded by ocean waves?
24. Differential erosion is referring to the erosion of coastlines with mixed geology that results in erosion in parts of the same coastline and deposition in another. T/F
25. What is the ocean wave phenomenon that creates this differential erosion?
26. Examples of coastal erosion at headlands include the following:
27. The following processes were identified in coastal erosion of headlands:

## Exercise 4:  Deposition at a Coastline

In addition to the sediment that is brought to the coastlines by streams, ocean waves play a crucial role in shaping coastlines.  Watch this video to learn how ocean waves are formed and answer the following questions:

## Exercise 5:  Submergent and Emergent Coastlines

In addition to streams, wind, ocean waves, and the geology of the coastline, sea-level rise impacts the shape of the coastlines. Watch this quick animation before answering some basic questions:
