# 6.3 Groundwater Contamination

## Exercise 5: Groundwater Models

In this section, we will use groundwater models to visualize groundwater flow below the ground using groundwater models. Because groundwater cannot be seen from above the ground, we often use groundwater models to visualize the movement of groundwater through different layers beneath the ground surface and study how contaminant plumes may develop when contaminants leak into the ground.

Watch the video demonstration of the Groundwater Model by a CofC instructor to help you answer the questions below (turn on close captioning if needed):

```{admonition} Groundwater Model
Use the above video to answer the following questions:

45. Identify three types of sediment that were shown in the model.
46. Which of the following sediment layer(s) can act as an aquifer?
47. Which of the following sediment layer(s) will act as an aquitard?
48. Explain your previous answers.
49. Where was the water table clearly visible?
50. What is an unconfined aquifer?
51. What is a confined aquifer?
52. How does the water table (level) in adjacent wells respond when a well is pumped (on the model, withdrawing water with a syringe):
53. What is this water table response in the adjacent wells called?
54. What happened to the water table in the adjacent wells when the pumping stopped?

Hydrologists (geologists who study groundwater) want to know how fast water moves through an aquifer. They inject dye into a well C (on the left) and test water samples daily from well B (on the far right) to look for traces of the dye. Wells C and B are 1.6 km apart and the dye was detected in Well C 42 days later. The location of the wells is indicated on the groundwater model in the video above. Determine the groundwater flow rate in m/hr.

$$
\text{Flow Rate} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}  
$$

55. Determine the distance between the wells in m (1 km = 1000 m): 
56. Determine the travel time for the dye in hr (1 day = 24 hr):
57. Determine the groundwater flow rate in m/hr:

A truck carrying hazardous chemicals overturned near Well C. Using the relative locations of Wells, A, B, and C on the groundwater model in the video, answer the following questions:

58. Groundwater from Well A will be affected by the chemical spill. T/F
59. Explain your previous answer.
60. Groundwater from Well B will be affected by the chemical spill. T/F
61. Explain your previous answer.
62. If the chemical contaminants travel at the same rate as the chemical dye, how long will it be before the chemicals reach Well B.
63. The aquifer tapped by Well D will be affected by this spill. T/F
64. Explain your previous answer.

## Exercise 6: Groundwater Contamination

In this section, we will focus on the history of groundwater contamination at the Hanford Nuclear site and assess if there is a danger to communities living downstream from this site. The Hanford Nuclear site in eastern Washington state on the banks of the Columbia River was the first plutonium processing plant in the world and was created during the second world war. Over the next several decades, they continued to produce plutonium for nuclear bombs before the eventual decommissioning bomb manufacturing. However, decades of operation left behind a legacy of highly contaminated groundwater, which includes dangerous levels of radionuclides and toxic chemicals. In this section, we will focus on the history of the site and the extent of groundwater contamination and assess if there is a danger to communities living downstream from this site. Use the information provided to learn more about the extent of the problem.

Watch the video at the link below. Take notes about the details and will be helpful for the questions below.
