#  **3 Volcanoes and  Igneous Rocks**

In this lab, we will focus on learning about volcanoes, how the theory of plate tectonics helps us understand why they occur.  We will also learn about two major types of volcanoes and the typical hazards associated with such volcanoes. Igneous rocks are associated with these volcanic environments, and therefore, we will also learn about the most common types of igneous rocks associated with these environments.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
-   the properties of magma and lava,
-   the differences between composite and shield volcanoes,
-   the role of plate tectonics in volcano hazards, and
-   different types of igneous rocks that are associated with volcanoes.
