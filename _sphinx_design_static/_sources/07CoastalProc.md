# **7 Coastal Processes**

Approximately 50% of the world's population lives within 100 km of a coastline. Many coastal areas are centers of economic activity and serve as major hubs for trade, transportation, and tourism. Coastlines provide a wide range of valuable natural resources, including fisheries and deposits of minerals, oil, and gas. Coastal ecosystems, such as salt marshes, mangrove forests, and coral reefs, provide important ecological services and act as buffers against storm surges and erosion, protecting inland areas from the impact of hurricanes and other natural disasters. Coastal areas provide scenic landscapes and natural beauty, attracting tourists and providing a sense of relaxation and well-being. Coastlines often hold cultural and historical significance for human populations. They have been important habitats for indigenous communities and are associated with cultural practices, traditions, and livelihoods. Coastal regions also feature historical sites, archaeological remains, and landmarks that contribute to the cultural heritage of a place.

Coastlines are vulnerable to various environmental challenges such as erosion, sea-level rise, and pollution. It is crucial to manage and protect these areas sustainably to ensure their continued benefits for future generations.

In this and the next lab, we will learn some basic geological processes that occur along coastlines similar to that of Charleston and how natural and anthropogenic factors are impacting our coastlines.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- basic terminology of coastal and shoreline processes – waves, tides, deltas, beaches
- how barrier islands and shoreline features are modified by natural processes, and
- how humans interact and modify shoreline environments.
