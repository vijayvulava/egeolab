# 6.1 Water Resources

## Exercise 1: The Water Cycle

In this section, we will focus on the basic principles of the water cycle and groundwater resources. The water cycle not only cycles water on all parts of the Earth system, but it also makes life possible on Earth. The hydrosphere (all forms of water) is also an important agent of geologic change. It shapes our planet through weathering and erosion, deposits minerals, alters rocks, and causes melting in the lithospheric material at subduction zones. Communities rely on water for consumption, power generation, crop production, and many other things.

Watch the video below for a quick introduction to the water cycle:

```{admonition} The Water Cycle
Use the resources below to answer the following questions:

- [13.1 The Hydrological Cycle – Physical Geology – 2nd Edition](https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeology2ed/chapter/13-1-the-hydrological-cycle/)
- Watch the above video

1. Water can be found in these three different forms on Earth.
2. On Earth, water is present in these reservoirs (check all that apply).
3. Which of the following is the largest reservoir of water on Earth?
4. Which of the following is the largest freshwater reservoir on Earth?
5. What are the three ways water precipitates on Earth?
6. Below are the many processes that are part of the water cycle. Identify the two basic processes that lead to the formation of groundwater aquifers.
7. If the ground surface is too saturated or there is too much asphalt, which of the following process is the most significant?
8. Even though groundwater is present deep below the ground surface it is moving.
9. Where does groundwater discharge?
10. What are two common ways water returns to the atmosphere?
```

## Exercise 2:  Groundwater

Groundwater is part of the hydrosphere that is freshwater and exists below the Earth’s surface in the pores of sediment and rock materials. Nearly all of the liquid fresh water on Earth is in this form.

14. What is an aquitard?
15. What is the water table?
16. What happens when the ground level dips below the water table?
17. Who is the biggest consumer of groundwater in the US?
18. How is an aquifer commonly replenished?
19. Aquifers can go dry. T/F
20. When we pump groundwater to the surface, how does the water table respond?
21. What is the typical timeline for the replenishment of the largest aquifers?
