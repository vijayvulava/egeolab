# 8.1 Coastal Storms

## Exercise 1: Hurricanes (Tropical Cyclones)

Tropical cyclones (regionally known as hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, etc.) are storms that originate in tropical ocean waters when the right conditions exist. These circulating systems contain a well-defined center and bands of high winds and rains and move from the open ocean onto land. Because of the energy they contain, these storms can cause enormous damage to life and property on land. Use the resources below to answer questions about hurricanes.

## Exercise 2: Hurricane Hugo

Hurricane Hugo was a major hurricane that made landfall just north of Charleston, SC in 1989. This damaging hurricane not only resulted in the loss of life and major property and structural damage, but it also exposed the unpreparedness of our coast and the city to hurricane hazards.

```{admonition} Hurricane Hugo - actual event
Use the information below to answer questions.

- National Weather Service site: [Hurricane Hugo – September 21-22, 1989 (weather.gov)](https://www.weather.gov/chs/HurricaneHugo-Sep1989).
- Use [the USGS map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/viewer/index.html?extent=-8962119.4132%2C3837692.7297%2C-8820328.7257%2C3899071.6634%2C102100) to evaluate hazards.
- Additional information at [Hurricane Hugo 1989(sc.gov)](https://www.dnr.sc.gov/climate/sco/hurricanes/pdfs/HurricaneHugo1989.pdf).
- SC DNR created a [Story Map of the disaster](https://arcg.is/0nSCLW) on the 30th anniversary.

18. Where exactly did this hurricane make landfall?
19. On the Saffir-Simpson scale, what was the category of this hurricane at landfall?
20. In addition to the extreme winds, what were the main causes of damage to the coastal areas?
21. The eye of the storm passed over the Charleston peninsula and this was estimated to have spared the area from the worst damage. Explain.
22. How much rainfall fell in the Charleston area?
23. How high was the storm surge in downtown Charleston?
24. Using the (XY) elevation tool in the map link above determine if Randolph Hall might have been inundated during this storm surge.
25. Are there locations within the Charleston peninsula that would not have been impacted?
```

Based on our knowledge of how hurricanes function, the location of a city or community north or south relative to the location of the landfall can influence how severe the impacts would be. Look at the image below that was produced using [an NWS model](https://www.weather.gov/chs/HurricaneHugo-Sep1989) that puts Hugo’s landfall to the south of Charleston at the Kiawah Island.

```{admonition} Hurricane Hugo - Model Scenario
Use the model scenario information provided above to answer questions.

26. Which location within the Charleston peninsula would not be impacted in this scenario?
27. How will Folly Beach and the other barrier islands do in this scenario?
28. Why is the landfall south of Charleston in this scenario bad for the Charleston area?
29. Describe at least two ways we are better prepared now in terms of technology than in 1989.

## Exercise 3: Hurricane Impacts

Dozens of tropical cyclones make landfall across coastal communities around the world and their impacts continue to increase due to changing climate.
