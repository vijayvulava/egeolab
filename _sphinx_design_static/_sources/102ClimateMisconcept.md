# 10.2 Climate Change Misconceptions

## Exercise 4: Climate Trends and Misconceptions

Climate and global change are being studied by millions of scientists around the world.  In addition, every country is documenting the changes happening within their borders each year.  All the data collected by the many different international governments and agencies document that Earth’s climate is changing at a rate not observed before. An overwhelming number of scientists agree that this change was caused by human activities.  Yet, there are climate skeptics with a megaphone and in powerful positions of power who continue to mislead the public about the impending deleterious impacts of a rapidly changing climate.  Here are some ways these skeptics [mislead the public](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/7-answers-to-climate-contrarian-nonsense/).

This section will investigate some of the common misconceptions related to the causes of the current climate change.

Atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ measurements are collected across the world at many places. Let’s explore the $\ce{CO2}$ record from the past. In the video below, atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ data is shown from current times and all the way back to 800,000 y (800 ky) BCE. The video also shows how the data was compiled.

Dr. Richard Alley – a prominent climate change researcher – explains how we collect $\ce{CO2}$ and temperature records from the ancient past.

```{admonition} Climate Trends
Use the videos above and the resources below to answer the following questions:

- See [Climate Levels Graph: A project of the 2 Degrees Institute](https://www.climatelevels.org/?pid=2degreesinstitute&theme=gray) to see the levels of $\ce{CO2}$ and how the data were collected.
- Also, see [15 Global Climate Change – An Introduction to Geology](https://opengeology.org/textbook/15-global-climate-change/#1522_Carbon_Dioxide)

41. $\ce{CO2}$ data was measured directly in the US since 1958. Where were these data collected?
42. These measurements show a cyclical annual variation in atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ concentrations.  How is this explained?
43. What is the overall $\ce{CO2}$ trend from 1958?
44. Ancient $\ce{CO2}$ and temperature data were collected indirectly.  What are such data called?
45. List four sources of proxy data used in climate studies.
46. How have $\ce{CO2}$ levels behaved over the past 800 ky?
47. What is the highest $\ce{CO2}$ concentration before the industrial era?
48. What is the lowest $\ce{CO2}$ concentration before the industrial era?
49. List two major reasons attributed to the natural variation in $\ce{CO2}$ concentrations over the past 800 ky.
50. In the above link, when did $\ce{CO2}$, $\ce{CH4}$, and $\ce{N2O}$ levels start to consistently rise?
51. Would it be reasonable to say that the rise in these GHG concentrations can be attributed to the industrial revolution?
52. When did the global temperature start to consistently rise?
53. When did the global mean sea levels start to consistently rise?
54. Is it reasonable to correlate the rise in GHG levels to a rise in global temperatures?
55. Calculate the rate of increase in $\ce{CO2}$ levels from 1850 to the present. (From the data in the first video, divide the difference in $\ce{CO2}$ concentrations in 1850 to the present by the number of years between 1850 to today.)
56. Repeat the $\ce{CO2}$ levels rate measurement from approximately 2000 y BCE to 15,000 (15 ky) BCE.
57. In which time period was the rate of $\ce{CO2}$ increase faster?
58. Is it reasonable to conclude that the modern rise in $\ce{CO2}$ concentrations can be attributed to human activity?

## Exercise 5: Variable Solar Activity


```{admonition} Solar Activity Cause Rise in Temperatures?
Use information at the following links to explore the links between solar activity and global temperatures.

- [What Is the Sun’s Role in Climate Change? – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet (nasa.gov)](https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2910/what-is-the-suns-role-in-climate-change/)
- Solar Irradiance section in [Causes | Facts – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet (nasa.gov)](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/)

59. Examining the graph at the first link, what is the range of Total Solar Irradiance measured since 1880?
60. How has the measured solar activity behaved since the 1970s?
61. According to researchers, lower solar activity is associated with what kind of climate across the world?
62. How has the global surface temperature behaved since the 1970s?
63. Warming caused by the sun will warm all layers of the atmosphere uniformly. T/F
64. Warming caused by GHG will warm all layers of the atmosphere uniformly. T/F
65. Which layer of the atmosphere warms the most because of the warming caused by GHG? (Hint: the layer closest to the Earth’s surface).
66. Based on the information available, can the increase in global temperatures be associated with solar activity?

## Exercise 6: Volcanoes Impact on Global Temperatures


```{admonition} Volcanoes Cause Rise in Temperatures? 
Let’s explore volcanic activity as related to climate change. Refer to the links below for answering the questions below:

- [Volcanoes Can Affect Climate (usgs.gov)](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/volcano-hazards/volcanoes-can-affect-climate)
- [Climate Levels Graph: A project of the 2 Degrees Institute](https://www.climatelevels.org/?pid=2degreesinstitute&theme=gray)

67. What are the three main products released into the atmosphere during major volcanic eruptions?
68. What are the two main gases released during volcanic eruptions?
69. Of these two gases, one causes cooling of the Earth’s climate.
70. Of these two gases, one causes warming of the Earth’s climate.
71. Several major volcanic eruptions in the past few centuries have released a significant amount of $\ce{SO2}$ into the atmosphere. T/F
72. How much $\ce{CO2}$ do volcanoes emit on annual basis?
73. What % of anthropogenic $\ce{CO2}$ emissions are volcano emissions equivalent to?
74. Combustion of fossil fuels requires $\ce{O2}$.  How do recent atmospheric $\ce{O2}$ levels behave?
75. Can we associate the global increase in $\ce{CO2}$ and decrease $\ce{O2}$ decrease to the burning of fossil fuels?
76. Based on the information available the increase in global temperatures be associated with volcanic emissions?
