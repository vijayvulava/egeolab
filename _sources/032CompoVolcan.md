# 3.2 Composite Volcanoes

In this section, we will explore composite volcanoes – also known as stratovolcanoes – which are known to be the most explosive and destructive volcanoes in the world. Their location is associated with specific types of plate boundaries as well as the composition of the magma. We will also study three composite volcanoes from different parts of the world.

The plate-tectonic settings of common types of volcanism. Composite volcanoes form at subduction zones, either on ocean-ocean convergent boundaries (left) or ocean-continent convergent boundaries (right). Both shield volcanoes and cinder cones form in areas of continental rifting. Shield volcanoes form above mantle plumes, but can also form at other tectonic settings. Sea-floor volcanism can take place at divergent boundaries, mantle plumes and ocean-ocean-convergent boundaries.

The figure shows the main features of a typical stratovolcano: 1) magma chamber, 2) upper layers of lithosphere, 3) the conduit or narrow pipe through which the lava erupts, 4) the base or edge of the volcano, 5) a sill of magma between layers of the volcano, 6) a diapir or feeder tube to the sill, 7) layers of tephra (ash) from previous eruptions, 8 & 9) layers of lava erupting from the vent and flowing down the sides of the volcano, 10) the crater at the top of the volcano, 11) layers of lava and tephra on (12), a parasitic cone. A parasitic cone is a small volcano located on the flank of a larger volcano such as Shastina on Mount Shasta. Kilauea sitting on the flank of Mauna Loa is not considered a parasitic cone because it has its own separate magma chamber,  13) the vents of the parasite and the main volcano, 14) the rim of the crater, 15) clouds of ash blown into the sky by the eruption; this settles back onto the volcano and surrounding land.

## Exercise 3: Mt. St. Helens

Mt. St. Helens is a volcano in the Cascade chain of volcanoes in western Washington and Oregon. In 1980, this volcano erupted causing significant damage and loss of life in this area.

## Exercise 5: Mt. Pelée, Martinique

Mt. Pelée is a composite volcano located in the Caribbean island of Martinique. In 1902 the dome collapse on the top of this volcano resulted in an explosion that killed virtually the entire population of the port city of St. Pierre.  The video below shows the type of hazard that destroyed St. Pierre.
