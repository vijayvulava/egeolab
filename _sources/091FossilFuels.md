# 9.1 Fossil Fuels

## Exercise 1: How is Power Generated?

Power generation makes modern human societies thrive. The method of generation is dependent on the availability of resources, technology, as well as the ability to deliver energy where it is needed. The video below summarizes some of the basic ways electricity is generated and delivered to our homes.
