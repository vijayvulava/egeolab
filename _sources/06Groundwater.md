# **6 Groundwater Resources**

In this lab, we will focus on learning about groundwater, which is the most important freshwater resource that well all rely on.  We will learn about different properties of aquifers as well learn about how groundwater could be contaminated by above ground human activities. 

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- water cycle and the role of groundwater
- important properties of rocks and sediments that allow aquifers to form, and
- vulnerability of aquifers to anthropogenic contamination.
