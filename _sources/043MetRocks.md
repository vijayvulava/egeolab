# 4.3 Metamorphic Rocks

In this section, we explore how metamorphism in active mountain-building zones can transform rocks. Metamorphism is an important part of the rock cycle and is associated with certain types of forces that occur below Earth’s surface. These forces are commonly present along with mountain building and volcanic zones. In this section, we will examine different kinds of metamorphic rocks and explore their connection to plate tectonics and mountain building.


## Exercise 5: Metamorphic Rocks Identification

The video below demonstrates the basic concepts identifying metamorphic rocks.

25. What is metamorphism?
26. List the two factors that are required for metamorphism to occur.
27. What is a protolith?
28. Which of the following rock types undergo metamorphosis?
29. What is foliation?
30. What type of stress needs to occur on a protolith for foliation to occur?
31. How do some minerals in a protolith reorient themselves as a result of this stress?
32. Which of the minerals you examined in Lab 1 are likely to reorient as a result of this stress?
33. Rocks undergo directed pressure in which one of these environments.
34. Explain your previous answer.
35. The type of metamorphism associated with environments where foliations develop are called:
36. What is a metamorphic grade?
37. Foliation increases with increasing metamorphic grade. T/F?
38. Grain sizes increase with increasing metamorphic grade. T/F?

```{admonition} Metamorphic Rock ID
Use the resources below to create a *Met Rock ID database* containing all the relevant information as shown in the template below:
- [6 Metamorphic Rocks – An Introduction to Geology (opengeology.org)](https://opengeology.org/textbook/6-metamorphic-rocks/)
- [MetRx Study Guide (georockme.com)](https://meg.georockme.com/)

- **In the Word document each page contains all the relevant information for each rock listed below, including an actual photo.  Upload this document to OAKS.**


| Rock             | Photo/URL | Protolith | Foliation | Met. Grade | Plate Tectonics |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Slate            |           |           |           |            |                |
| Phyllite         |           |           |           |            |                |
| Schist           |           |           |           |            |                |
| Gneiss           |           |           |           |            |                |
| Metaconglomerate |           |           |           |            |                |
| Marble           |           |           |           |            |                |
| Quartzite        |           |           |           |            |           | 


*Notes: In the above table you can list Foliation as High, Medium, Low, None. For the Met. Grade (metamorphic grade), you can list the rock as High, Medium, Low. Plate tectonics can list the environment as Convergent, Divergent, Transform, or Volcanic Zones.*

```{admonition} Metamorphic Rock Properties and Identification
Use your *Met Rock ID database* to answer the questions in this section:

39. List the foliated rocks in the order of increasing metamorphic grade.
40. Identify the protolith for the foliated metamorphic rocks studied in the previous questions.
41. Foliated metamorphic rocks can be expected at these mountain ranges.
42. Marble and quartzite have foliations. T/F?
43. Foliations only develop if these properties are present.
44. Identify the protolith for quartzite.
45. Quartzite typically forms at convergent plate boundaries. Why does it not have foliations?
46. Identify the protolith for marble.
47. Marble forms in contact metamorphic environments. Identify these environments.
48. Grain sizes increase during contact metamorphism. T/F?
49. Given your understanding of where mountains form and the potential for landslides in these areas, make two recommendations for reducing the risk of landslides.
