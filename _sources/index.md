# Environmental Geology Laboratory Manual

This is an online version of the lab instruction manual for Environmental Geology students at the College of Charleston.  This lab manual is based on the materials developed for the in-class lab instruction by instructors at the College of Charleston. Professor Vijay Vulava adapted these materials for use in an online format.

The semester-length lab contains 10 lab modules.  They cover topics from Earth's resources, plate tectonics, environmental processes, and hazards. Use the links on the left to navigate to each lab or a section.

Each lab includes links to Open Educational Resources (OER), excellent instructional videos posted by instructors from the broad Earth Sciences communities across the world, maps, and other interactive content. 

This course are specifically tailored for students at the College of Charleston’s Environmental Geology courses (GEOL 103 and HONS 155) and can be adapted for students at other academic institutions.
