# 5.2 Sedimentary Rocks

In this section, we focus on sedimentary rocks.  Sedimentary rocks are formed by sedimentary processes, including sediments lithifying and precipitation from solution. 

Sedimentary rock is classified into two main categories: clastic and chemical. Clastic or detrital sedimentary rocks are made from pieces of bedrock, sediment, derived primarily by mechanical weathering. Clastic rocks may also include chemically weathered sediment. 

Clastic rocks are classified by grain shape, grain size, and sorting. Chemical sedimentary rocks are precipitated from water saturated with dissolved minerals. Chemical rocks are classified mainly by composition of minerals in the rock.

## Exercise 3:  Sedimentary Rocks

Watch the videos below by Dr. Scott Brande of the University of Alabama - the videos show how to identify and classify sedimentary rocks.

```{admonition} Sedimentary Rock ID
Use the resources below to create a *Sed Rock ID database* containing all the relevant information as shown in the template below:
- [5 Weathering, Erosion, and Sedimentary Rocks â€“ An Introduction to Geology](https://opengeology.org/textbook/5-weathering-erosion-and-sedimentary-rocks/#53_Sedimentary_rocks)
- [SedRx Study Guide (georockme.com)](https://seg.georockme.com/home)

- **In the Word document each page contains all the relevant information for each rock listed below, including an actual photo.  Upload this document to OAKS.**

| Rock         | Photo/URL | Origin | Clastic/Chemical | Clast Size |
|--------------|-----------|--------|------------------|------------|
| Shale        |           |        |                  |            |
| Sandstone    |           |        |                  |            |
| Conglomerate |           |        |                  |            |
| Breccia      |           |        |                  |            |
| Limestone    |           |        |                  |            |
| Halite       |           |        |                  |            |
| Coal         |           |        |                  |            |

*Notes: In the above table, Clast Size applies to Clastic Rocks only and vary based on the energy of the depositional environments.*

```{admonition} Sedimentary Rocks
Use your *Sed Rock ID database* to answer the questions in this section:

17. Identify the three clastic sedimentary rocks in this list.
18. Match the three clastic sedimentary rocks with the sediment size.
19. Identify the non-clastic (chemical/organic/biogenic) sedimentary rocks in this list.
20. What mineral is predominant in the non-clastic sedimentary rocks?
