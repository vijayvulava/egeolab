# 9.3 Renewable Energy

The promise of renewable energy is that there is a limitless source of fuel that can sustainably power our modern societies. Use the resources below to investigate different forms of renewable energy.

## Exercise 7: Solar Energy

There is an abundant amount of solar power that is available to be tapped without running out of this resource in human times.  However, there are technological challenges that need to be surmounted to reliably harness this source of power.

```{admonition} Solar Energy in SC
Navigate to [U.S. Energy Atlas (eia.gov)](https://atlas.eia.gov/app/65df045e1c0c4b609df86cc92be0bee4) and click on the “Layer List” button on the top-right.  Click on the “Eye Icon” to turn on the Power Plants layer and turn off all other layers. Now click on the Triangle Dropdown option to see different types of Power Plants in the US. Select “Power Plants – Solar”

84. Where are more solar power plants present in the continental US?
85. How many solar power plants are in South Carolina?
86. How many MW does the typical solar power plant produce in SC?
```


## Exercise 8: Wind Energy

Wind power has enormous potential across many parts of the US. If optimal locations are available this resource has enormous benefits.
