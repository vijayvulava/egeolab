## Exercise 8: Interpreting Topography from Maps

Understanding stream behavior requires a good understanding of the topography of the region. Geologists use topographic maps to show topography of an area. In the two videos below, the narrators describe different features to look for in a topographical map and how such maps can be used in practical settings.

```{admonition} Topographic Maps
Watch the videos for the following questions:

53. What do the contour lines on the map represent?
54. What is the contour interval of the map in the first video?
55. What does the contour interval mean?
56. What is an index contour line?
57. What is the difference in elevation between each index contour?
58. Match the flat and steep areas in the topographic maps with the patterns in contour lines.
59. On a topographic map, contour lines can touch or cross. T/F
60. In the Crater Lake map, determine the approximate elevation of the Trailhead at the Rim Drive junction at the southern part of Crater Lake.
61. Determine the approximate elevation of water in Crater Lake.
62. Determine the approximate elevation of the rim of the crater on the Wizard Island inside the Crater Lake.
63. Determine the contour interval near Crater Lake.

## Exercise 9:  Topography of Streams

A stream that flows on a wide, flat floodplain with a low gradient typically carries only sand-sized and finer sediments and develops a sinuous (curvy) flow pattern. When a stream flows around a corner, the water on the outside has farther to go and tends to flow faster. This leads to erosion of the banks on the outside of the curve, deposition on the inside, and the formation of a point bar. Over time, the sinuosity of the stream becomes increasingly exaggerated, and the channel migrates around within its flood plain, forming a meandering pattern.

Study the topography of the two river systems below. The first stream is the [New River in West Virginia](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/viewer/index.html?extent=-9036588.8549%2C4553097.6382%2C-8995007.1115%2C4570754.5918%2C102100) (and the site of the newest National Park!). This river is a tributary of the Ohio River and is flowing from the southeast direction towards the north. Use the scale bar to perform analysis on this section of the river system.

The second stream is [the Saint Francis River in Arkansas](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/viewer/index.html?extent=-10103955.5179%2C4190136.4094%2C-10062373.7745%2C4207793.3629%2C102100). This river is a tributary of the Mississippi River and is flowing from the north to the south. Use the scale bar to perform analysis on this section of the river system.

- Answer the following questions:

64. Which of the two rivers, the New River or the Saint Francis River, has steeper topography within the floodplain?
65. Explain your previous answer.
66. Which of the two rivers, the New River or the Saint Francis River, can cause more erosion?
67. Explain your previous answer.
68. The approximate channel length (in miles) of the New River and the Saint Francis River. (Use the scale bar below the map to get a good estimate)
69. The approximate straight-line length (in miles) of the New River and the Saint Francis River. (Use the scale bar below the map to get a good estimate)
70. The approximate sinuosity (no units) of the New River and the Saint Francis River. 

$$ 
\text{Sinuosity} = \frac{\text{Channel Length}}{\text{Straight-Line Length}}
$$

71. The highest elevation (in feet) of the New River and the Saint Francis River.
72. The lowest elevation (in feet) of the New River and the Saint Francis River.
73. The vertical drop (in feet) of the New River and the Saint Francis River.
74. The gradient (in ft/miles) of the New River and the Saint Francis River.
