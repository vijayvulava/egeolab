# **8 Coastal Hazards**

Coastlines are susceptible to various geological hazards due to their dynamic nature and interactions between land and water. In this lab, we focus on hazards created due to tropical storms, coastal erosion, as well as inadvertent erosion on coastlines due to human infrastructure.  

It's important to note that the intensity and frequency of these hazards can vary depending on local geography, climate conditions, and human interventions. Coastal planning, risk assessment, and effective mitigation measures are crucial for managing these geological hazards and reducing their impact on coastal communities.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- how coastal erosion is modifying the shorelines near Charleston,
- how various measures are implemented to slow erosion, and
- typical features on the shorelines that are indicative of coastal erosion.
