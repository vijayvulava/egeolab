# **10 Global Change**

Global change refers to the significant and long-term alterations occurring on a global scale across various aspects of the Earth's systems, including the environment, climate, biodiversity, and human societies. These changes include: 

- Long-term shifts in temperature patterns, precipitation, wind patterns, and other climate variables due to increased greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from human activities. It leads to rising global temperatures, sea-level rise, altered weather patterns, more frequent extreme weather events, and impacts on ecosystems and human societies.
- Biodiversity loss, which refers to the ongoing decline in the variety and abundance of plant and animal species worldwide. 
- Land use change, such as deforestation, urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development, result in significant land use changes globally. 
- Resource depletion of natural resources, including fossil fuels, minerals, freshwater, and forests. 
- Increasing human populations and the concentration of people in urban areas put pressure on resources, energy demand, infrastructure, and ecosystems. 
- Air and water pollution, including emissions from industries, transportation, and agriculture, have widespread impacts on ecosystems, human health, and climate. 

In this lab we learn about the basic ideas behind climate change, common misconceptions, and consequences of global change. Addressing global change requires collective efforts from individuals, communities, governments, and international communities. Sustainable development, conservation practices, renewable energy adoption, responsible land use planning, and global cooperation on climate action and biodiversity conservation are crucial to mitigate the negative impacts of global change and promote a more sustainable and resilient future.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- main causes for climate change,
- lines of evidence to support climate change, and
- consequences of rapidly changing climate.
