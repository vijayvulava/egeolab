# **5 Surficial Processes and Sedimentary Rocks**

In this lab, we will focus on learning about geological processes that occur on the Earth’s surface. These processes include weathering, erosion, and deposition. Specifically, we will also focus on how water and streams sculpt our landscapes as well as erode and deposit sediment. Since deposited sediment can turn into sedimentary rocks, we will also learn about the most common types of sedimentary rocks associated with these environments.

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn and demonstrate their understanding of
- the role of erosion and deposition in the creation of sedimentary rocks,
- how streams sculpt landscapes and transport sediment, and
- how topographic maps can be used to study landscapes.
