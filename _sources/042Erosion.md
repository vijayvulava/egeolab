# 4.2 Erosion and Mass Wasting

In this section, we focus on how the process of erosion slowly changes mountains and also leads to mass wasting. Earth’s surface environments have a significant impact on landscapes. Forces such as water, wind, ice, gravity, and biological organisms sculpt and shape these landscaped by the process of weathering and erosion. The sudden movement of land and soil in mountainous environments due to erosion can result in mass wasting events such as landslides. 

We will investigate the causes of mass wasting events and focus on the Oso Landslide – one of the deadliest landslides that occurred in the US in recent times.

The video below demonstrates the basic concepts of erosion due to gravity.

## Exercise 2: Erosion and Mass Wasting

```{admonition} Erosion and Mass Wasting
Use the following resources to answer the questions in this section:

- [5 Weathering, Erosion, and Sedimentary Rocks – An Introduction to Geology](https://slcc.pressbooks.pub/introgeology/chapter/5-weathering-erosion-and-sedimentary-rocks/)
- [10 Mass Wasting – An Introduction to Geology](https://slcc.pressbooks.pub/introgeology/chapter/10-mass-wasting/)

8. Define erosion.
9. Of the three mountain ranges studied previously, which range has undergone the most erosion?
10. The age of a mountain range correlates positively with the amount of erosion. T/F
11. What geographic feature is common to the areas of elevated risk of landslides and other types of mass wasting?
12. Why does this feature have a higher landslide risk?
13. List the seven most common triggers that cause landslides.
14. Identify the natural triggers from the list.
15. Identify the anthropogenic triggers from the list.

## Exercise 3:  The 2014 Oso Landslide

In 2014, a major landslide occurred near Oso, Washington wiped out a rural community and taking the lives of 43 people. We will investigate why this landslide occurred and if humans may have contributed to this disaster.

The video below gives a brief overview of how landslides occur.

## Exercise 4: Climate Change and Natural Disasters

The rapidly changing climate on Earth is increasing extreme weather events as well as shifts in global climate patterns. These changes may contribute to increasing the intensity and frequency of natural disasters.

Use the following resources to answer the questions in this section:

- [A Slippery Slope: Could Climate Change Lead to More Landslides? – Eos](https://eos.org/features/a-slippery-slope-could-climate-change-lead-to-more-landslides)

23. List two reasons how the risk of landslides is likely to get worse as the climate changes.
24. According to this article, how does climate change reduce landslide risk?-
