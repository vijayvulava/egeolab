# 3.3 Shield Volcanoes

In this section, we review an example of a shield volcano and the hazards associated with such volcanoes. Shield volcanoes are typically the largest volcanoes on Earth and occur on the seafloor due to specific plate tectonic activity. Due to the properties of the magma that erupts from underneath the seafloor, the volcanoes have a broad shield-like profile.

## Exercise 6: Shield Volcanoes

```{admonition} Shield Volcanoes
Use the map above and the resources below to answer the following questions.

-   [4 Igneous Processes and Volcanoes – An Introduction to Geology (opengeology.org)](https://opengeology.org/textbook/4-igneous-processes-and-volcanoes/#452_Volcano_Features_and_Types)
-  [4.3 Types of Volcanoes – Physical Geology – 2nd Edition](https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeology2ed/chapter/4-3-types-of-volcanoes/)

48.  How would you characterize the profile of a shield volcano: Tall and conical or broad dome-like and wide?
49.  Based on their shape, these volcanoes form from magma with high silica content (high viscosity) or low silica content (low viscosity)?
50.  Describe why shield volcanoes have the above profile.
51.  Based on what we’ve learned so far, most eruptions at shield volcanoes are explosive or effusive?
```


## Exercise 7: Kilauea, Hawaii

Kilauea is the most active volcano located on the Big Island of the Hawaii chain of islands.  Recent eruptions have caused immense damage to property and homes, but no lives we lost.

-   Watch the hot spot animation

52.  What is/are the name(s) of the tectonic plates are involved at this location?
53.  This volcano is located on top of a hot spot. Define hot spot.
54.  Based on the hot spot animation, select the correct scenario that describes how the volcano chain formed.
55.  The 2018 eruption was Explosive or Effusive?
56.  During the 2018 eruption, 700 homes were destroyed but no one was killed. Why are volcanic hazards associated with shield volcanoes less dangerous than the hazards associated with composite volcanoes?
57.  What types of rocks are found at this volcano?
