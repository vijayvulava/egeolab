# 8.2 Coastal Erosion

## Exercise 4: Coastal Erosion

Wave action and flooding in coastal areas can wear down or carry away rocks, soils, and/or sands along the coast resulting in coastal erosion. Coastal storms that include large waves, storm surge, potentially in combination with high tides, create more damaging conditions to the coastline and any built structures that exist on the coastline. Seasonal changes occur due to late summer/fall hurricanes and winter storms. Coastal storm events often devastate barrier islands, which buffer the main coastlines from the storm energy. Rising sea levels and increasing intensity and frequency of coastal storms are making coastal erosion worse.

The videos explain how coastal erosion occurs and highlights the many ways damage is occurring to human infrastructure.

39. Coastal erosion is the wearing away and transportation of material away from one section of a coastline. T/F
40. Coastal erosion removes material from the shoreline and redistributes it to other parts of the coastline. T/F
41. Coastal erosion can also occur gradually over a long time due to sediment deficits. T/F
42. Coastal erosion is reversible. T/F
43. What is the main cause of erosion along a coastline?
44. This feature along the coastline offers the best protection to the mainland from coastal storms.
45. How do tropical storms impact coastal erosion?
46. What is the estimated value of property loss each year due to coastal erosion in the US?
47. These two coastlines of the US are experiencing the highest coastal recession.
```

## Exercise 5: Coastal Engineering

Coastline erosion around the world, particularly in large cities, is often at considerable risk due to coastal erosion. The erosion is often mitigated using a combination of coastal structures that can arrest the loss of sediment, redirect wave energy, or redirect the flow of sediment along coastlines.

59. What type of coastal structure is installed here?
60. Which side of this structure is accumulating sediment?
61. Which side of this structure is losing sediment?
62. Based on the gain and loss of sediment next to the structure, what is the direction of longshore drift?

Using [beach nourishment data](https://beachno.wcu.edu/state/SC) for South Carolina, answer the following questions:

63. Move your mouse cursor on the US coastal states at [beach nourishment site](https://beachno.wcu.edu/) and identify which coast of the US has the highest beach nourishment episodes.
64. Move your mouse cursor on the map and identify which US state has the highest beach nourishment episodes.
65. How many different episodes of beach nourishment have occurred in SC?
66. What is the approximate cost (in 2022 cost) of all these beach nourishments (round off to the nearest million)?
67. What is the approximate cost (in 2022 cost) of Folly Beach nourishments (round off to the nearest million)?
68. What is the primary funding source for these beach nourishment projects?
69. Explain if this source of funding may be reasonable. Give one each of Pro and Con rationale.
