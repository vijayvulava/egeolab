# 5.4 Topography of Landscapes

## Exercise 8: Interpreting Topography from Maps

Understanding stream behavior requires a good understanding of the topography of the region. Geologists use topographic maps to showÂ topography of an area. In the two videos below, the narrators describe different features to look for in a topographical map and how such maps can be used in practical settings.

Watch the videos for the following questions:

53. What do the contour lines on the map represent?
54. What is the contour interval of the map in the first video?
55. What does the contour interval mean?
56. What is an index contour line?
57. What is the difference in elevation between each index contour?
58. Match the flat and steep areas in the topographic maps with the patterns in contour lines.
59. On a topographic map, contour lines can touch or cross. T/F
60. In the Crater Lake map, determine the approximate elevation of the Trailhead at the Rim Drive junction at the southern part of Crater Lake.
61. Determine the approximate elevation of water in Crater Lake.
62. Determine the approximate elevation of the rim of the crater on the Wizard Island inside the Crater Lake.
63. Determine the contour interval near Crater Lake.

## Exercise 9:  Topography of Streams

A stream that flows on a wide, flat floodplain with a low gradient typically carries only sand-sized and finer sediments and develops a sinuous (curvy) flow pattern. When a stream flows around a corner, the water on the outside has farther to go and tends to flow faster. This leads to erosion of the banks on the outside of the curve, deposition on the inside, and the formation of a point bar. Over time, the sinuosity of the stream becomes increasingly exaggerated, and the channel migrates around within its flood plain, forming a meandering pattern.

Streams that flow in steeper terrain or high-gradient streams can carry larger sediment and may form deep incised channels as well as braided streams. Such streams are typical in the headwater sections of a stream system.

In this exercise, we will study small sections of the 700-mile-long Kuskokwim River in southwestern Alaska near the Denali National Wilderness Area.  This river is the longest river that flows in a single US state, and uninterrupted and unmodified by human activity. There are no such rivers in the continental US.

- Answer the following questions:

64. Which of the two sections, the Kuskokwim River or the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River, has steeper topography within the floodplain?
65. How were you able to determine the steepness of the terrain?
66. In what direction are the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River flowing?
67. How were you able to determine the direction of flow?
68. Which of the two rivers, the Kuskokwim River or the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River, is likely to cause more erosion?
69. Explain your previous answer.
70. The approximate channel length (in miles) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River. (Use the scale bar below the map to get a good estimate. Using a string to trace the length on a printed map will yield a more accurate length.)
71. The approximate straight-line length (in miles) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River. (Use the scale bar below the map to get a good estimate)
72. The approximate sinuosity (no units) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River. 

$$ 
\text{Sinuosity} = \frac{\text{Channel Length}}{\text{Straight-Line Length}}
$$

73. The highest elevation (in feet) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River.
74. The lowest elevation (in feet) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River.
75. The vertical drop (in feet) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River.
76. The gradient (in ft/miles) of the Kuskokwim River and the Windy Fork Middle Fork Kuskokwim River. 

$$ 
\text{Gradient} = \frac{\text{Vertical Drop}}{\text{Straight-Line Length}}
$$

77. Which river section has the steeper gradient?
78. Which river section has a more meandering channel?
79. Based on your assessment of both sections of the stream, how are sinuosity and the gradient related?
